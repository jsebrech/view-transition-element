# Vanilla view transitions

A vanilla JS implementation of a single page router `<view-route>` 
and declarative view transitions using a `<view-transition>` custom element. 
Both can be used independently.

The `<view-transition>` element is loosely based on React's `<ViewTransition>`:

More specifically, the example here is based on the *final result* example code of that blog post:

This repo can also be used as a template for a vanilla single page application.

Part of the [Plain Vanilla Web](https://plainvanillaweb.com) project.
